Broadly following this useful [tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/setup.html), we can get started with:

```
$ cargo install cargo-generate
```

It failed about 4 times for me while I sorted out its dependencies, and made space for it in `TMPDIR`. Seems like a lot of hassle for a code generator that I'm going to use approximately once. Oh well.

Generate the demo project:

```
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template .
ðŸ¤·   Project Name : hello-rust
...
$ mv hello-rust/* .
$ mv hello-rust/.??* .
$ rm -rf hello-rust
```

Attempt to build it (expect some warnings as well):

```
$ wasm-pack build
...
[INFO]: Installing wasm-bindgen...
Error: failed to download from https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases/download/version_90/binaryen-version_90-x86-linux.tar.gz
To disable `wasm-opt`, add `wasm-opt = false` to your package metadata in your `Cargo.toml`.
```

There's nothing wrong with that link, so what gives? There's a comment in the `Cargo.toml` about needing nightly builds of Rust. So

```
$ rustup install nightly
$ rustup default nightly
```

Same error on build. We can follow the hint, but a) it's really imprecise, and b) we might eventually want to optimize. So in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]
wasm-opt = false
```

then we can build:

```
$ wasm-pack build
...
[INFO]: Optional fields missing from Cargo.toml: 'description', 'repository', and 'license'. These are not necessary, but recommended

$ ls pkg/
README.md  hello_rust.d.ts  hello_rust.js  hello_rust_bg.js  hello_rust_bg.wasm  hello_rust_bg.wasm.d.ts  package.json
```

## Hosting the Generated WASM in an HTTP Server

We can use that `pkg` as a module in a Node.js app, like it describes in the tutorial.

```
$ npm init wasm-app www
```

add the dependency in `www/package.json`:

```
  "dependencies": {
    "hello-rust": "file:../pkg"
  }
```

fix the import in `index.js`:

```
import * as wasm from "hello-rust";
```

Install dependencies and run:

```
$ cd www
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

It pops up an alert in the browswer. It does it by using `webpack` to generate yet another JavaScript to launch the WASM. Sigh.

## Manually Create the WASM Dependencies

Instead of using the generated JavaScript from `wasm-pack` we could write a module that defines  all the imports manually and injects them into the `WebAssembly`. In this case there is only one import for the `alert()` function. Example:

```javascript
var bytes;

if (typeof fetch === 'undefined') {
  let dir = await import('path').then(path => path.dirname(import.meta.url).replace('file:/', ''));
  bytes = await import('fs').then(fs => fs.readFileSync(dir + '/hello_rust_bg.wasm'));
} else {
  bytes = await fetch('./hello_rust_bg.wasm').then(response => response.arrayBuffer());
}

const decoder = new TextDecoder();

let memory;
let imports = {"./hello_rust_bg.js": {
        "__wbg_alert_a899de29f2865bbe": (ptr,len) => console.log(decoder.decode(new Uint8Array(memory.buffer, ptr, len)))
    }
};
var wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, imports);
memory = wasm.instance.exports.memory;
let greet = () => {
  wasm.instance.exports.greet();
};

export {greet};
export default greet;
```

The mangled name of the import is unfortunate, but we can work with it. With that wrapper we can use Spring Boot to host the application instead of Node.js.
