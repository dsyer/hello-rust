Broadly following this useful [tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/setup.html), we can get started with:

```
$ cargo install cargo-generate
```

It failed about 4 times for me while I sorted out its dependencies, and made space for it in `TMPDIR`. Seems like a lot of hassle for a code generator that I'm going to use approximately once. Oh well.
